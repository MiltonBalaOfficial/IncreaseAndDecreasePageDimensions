# IncreaseAndDecreasePageDimensions

Extend your page! Now you can increase/decrease the page dimension for a single page or for all the pages. For the documents having PDF background extra space has no background and the area appears transparent. If you want the area presenting better, then go to `preference` > `view` > `background color between pages` and change the color according to your PDF background. But keep it mind that If you print the document the area will remain transparent!

## Installation Steps

1. **Place the folder** (`The Plugin folder`) in:
   - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\xournalpp\plugins\` on Windows 
     *Note: The `AppData` folder may be hidden.*
   - `~/.config/xournalpp/plugins` on Linux or MacOS

1. **Place the icons** (`provided icons(if any)`) in:
   - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\share\icons\hicolor\scalable\actions` on Windows,
   - `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/actions/` on Linux or MacOS

2. **In the Xournal++ app**:
  Open menu `View > Toolbars > Customize`(Stable version) or `Edit > Toolbars > Customize` (Nightly version). You will find the copied icons in the `Plugins` section. Place them at a suitable location in the toolbar. (make sure the version of your Xournalapp support Plugin icons)

3. **Use the plugin** as needed

## If you want to code yourself

Currently Increase/decrease value is in points, you can change it to cm and also page%wise. To do so, open `ChangePageDimension.lua` follow the instruction there, its done! Enjoy!

If you want to code yourself and if you are beginner then I recommend you to work with the `IncreasePageSize(for beginner)` file.

There is an extra file `IncreaseProportionally (you may try something new)` for getting space in all direction (will not work with the PDFs), you can give a try.

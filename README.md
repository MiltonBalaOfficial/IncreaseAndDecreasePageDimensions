# IncreaseAndDecreasePageDimensions

Extend your page! Now you can increase/decrease the page dimension for a single page or for all the pages. For the documents having PDF background extra space has no background and the area appears transparent. If you want the area presenting better, then go to `preference` > `view` > `background color between pages` and change the color according to your PDF background. But keep it mind that If you print the document the area will remain transparent!

## Installation Steps

1. **Place the folder** (`The Plugin folder`) in:
   - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\xournalpp\plugins\` on Windows 
     *Note: The `AppData` folder may be hidden.*
   - `~/.config/xournalpp/plugins` on Linux or MacOS

1. **Place the icons** () in:
   - `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\share\icons\hicolor\scalable\actions` on Windows,
   - `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/actions/` on Linux or MacOS

2. **In the Xournal++ app**:
  Open menu `Edit > Toolbars > Customize`. You will find the copied icons in the `Plugins` section. Place them at a suitable location in the toolbar. (make sure the version of your Xournalapp support Plugin icons)

3. **Use the plugin** as needed


## Direction of Use

1. Easy to use, just click on the icons.
2. Shortcuts are Alt + 2,3,4,5. You may change if you want.

## If you want to code yourself
If you want to code yourself and if you are beginner then I recommend you to work with the `IncreasePageSize(for beginner)` file, it dose the same thing.

There is an extra file `IncreaseProportionally (you may try something new)` for getting space in all direction (will not work with the PDFs), you can give a try.
